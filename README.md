Answers to fCC.com's Javascript algorithm scripting problems. Each difficulty level problem sets are found in separate, appropreiately named directories.

Each file is formated as such:

```javascript
/*
 * At the top of the file, the problem is stated (cut/copy from freeCodeCamp).
 */

function algoScript(variable) {
     // the coding itself solving above stated problem.
     // All code is my own work.
     return variable;
}

console.log(algoScript("test"));
// a couple of calls to function with each call's result in a comment directly below
// not all test cases used by freeCodeCamp are in the files; just enough to get the gist
```

As of 3/7/17, I have not completed all of freeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithm Scripting challenges. I will continue to update this repro as I solve more problems.

Update: As of 3/26/17, I have finished all of the Basic and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.
