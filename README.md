Answers to fCC.com's Javascript algorithm scripting problems. Each difficulty level problem sets are found in separate, appropreiately named directories.

Each file is formated as such:

```javascript
/*
 * At the top of the file, the problem is stated (cut/copy from freeCodeCamp).
 */

function algoScript(variable) {
     // the coding itself solving above stated problem.
     // All code is my own work.
     return variable;
}

console.log(algoScript("test"));
// a couple of calls to function with each call's result in a comment directly below
// not all test cases used by freeCodeCamp are in the files; just enough to get the gist
```

**UPDATE**: As of Feb 1, 2019, I have claimed freeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures.
